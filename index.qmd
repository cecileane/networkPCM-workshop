This repository contains materials for a workshop at the Botany 2023 conference
on 2023-07-23. This session is part of the workshop
"Methodological advances in reticulate evolution"
organized by George Tiley & Claudia Sol√≠s-Lemus.

Goal: learn to analyze trait data using phylogenetic comparative methods (PCMs)
on reticulate phylogenies, modelled by phylogenetic networks --also named
admixture graphs when modelling closely-related populations.
We will use methods implemented [PhyloNetworks](https://github.com/crsl4/PhyloNetworks.jl).

You can find and clone the workshop material at this
[github repository](https://github.com/cecileane/networkPCM-workshop).

### preparation

What you should do prior to the workshop:

- install [Julia](https://www.julialang.org/downloads/)
  and add it to your [`PATH`](https://julialang.org/downloads/platform/#optional_add_julia_to_path)
- install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
  or another editor, if you don't have one already.

If you use VSCode, like we will demonstrate, then within VSCode:

- add `code` to your `PATH`, by opening the command palette then
  searching for "shell command"
- within VSCode, install the [Julia extension](https://www.julia-vscode.org/docs/stable/setup/)
  and the [Quarto extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=quarto.quarto).

Install Julia and some packages:

- Open julia, either in a terminal, or terminal integrated
  in VSCode, or by opening the app
- within julia, install [PhyloNetworks](http://crsl4.github.io/PhyloNetworks.jl/latest/man/installation/)
  and [PhyloPlots](https://cecileane.github.io/PhyloPlots.jl/stable/man/installation/#Installation).
