This repository contains materials for a workshop at the Botany 2023 conference
on 2023-07-23. This session is part of the workshop
"Methodological advances in reticulate evolution"
organized by George Tiley & Claudia Sol√≠s-Lemus.

Goal: learn to analyze trait data using phylogenetic comparative methods (PCMs)
on reticulate phylogenies, modelled by phylogenetic networks --also named
admixture graphs when modelling closely-related populations.
We will use methods implemented [PhyloNetworks](https://github.com/crsl4/PhyloNetworks.jl).

You can find and clone the workshop material at this
[github repository](https://github.com/cecileane/networkPCM-workshop).
