Comparative methods are meant to answer questions about trait evolution.
In this workshop, we will learn about methods on networks:

- to account for reticulation in the phylogeny, and
- to look at how reticulation might have affected trait evolution.

## topics we will cover

- How to calibrate a network, if needed
- continuous response: phylogenetic regression & phylogenetic ANOVA
  when the phylogeny is a network. Predictors can be continuous or discrete.
  * ancestral state reconstruction
  * how account for within-species variation in the response trait
  * how to measure the impact of gene flow
- discrete trait
  * ancestral state reconstruction
  * was the trait via gene flow?
- How to visualize the results

## let's get started

load the packages we will use:

```{julia}
#| code-fold: show
using CSV               # read/write CSV and similar formats
using DataFrames        # versatile tabular data format
using PhyloNetworks     # includes many utilities
using PhyloPlots        # for plotting networks: via R
using RCall             # run R within Julia
```

We will use data on *Polemonium* from
[Rose et al. 2021](https://doi.org/10.1093/sysbio/syaa049) and
[Teo et al. 2023](https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.05.12.490814).

![*Polemonium californicum*, by Jeffrey Rose](https://polemoniaceae.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/polemonium_californicum.jpg)

first load the network topology:

```{julia}
#| code-fold: show
snaq_net = readTopology("data/polemonium_network_fromSNaQ.phy");
R"par"(mar=[0,0,0,0], cex=0.7); # 0 margins, cex<1 for smaller 'character expansion'
plot(snaq_net; showedgelength=true, xlim=[0,18]); # increased limit to see full taxon labels
```

then the trait data

```{julia}
#| code-fold: show
traits_indiv = CSV.File("data/polemonium_traits_individual.csv") |> DataFrame
```
